/* Exercise: String Literals
 *
 * In REXX, strings can be enclosed in either single quotes (')
 * or double quotes ("). Both work the same way.
 *
 * To include a quote character inside a string, double it:
 *   'It''s'  produces  It's
 *   "She said ""hi"""  produces  She said "hi"
 *
 * Your task: Fix the SAY instruction so it prints:
 *   REXX says "Hello!"
 */

/* I AM NOT DONE */

SAY 'REXX says Hello!'
