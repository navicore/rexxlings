# Hint: Comparison Operators

In REXX, comparisons return `1` for true and `0` for false.

Work through each one:

- `10 = 10` — Are they equal? Yes, so `1`.
- `10 \= 5` — Are they NOT equal? Yes they differ, so `1`.
- `3 > 7` — Is 3 greater than 7? No, so `0`.
- `3 < 7` — Is 3 less than 7? Yes, so `1`.
- `5 >= 5` — Is 5 greater than OR equal to 5? Yes (equal), so `1`.
- `4 <= 3` — Is 4 less than or equal to 3? No, so `0`.

Replace each `???` in the test calls with either `'1'` or `'0'`.
