# Hint: Exponentiation (Power)

The `**` operator raises a number to a power:

```rexx
answer = 2 ** 3     /* 2*2*2 = 8 */
answer = 5 ** 2     /* 5*5 = 25 */
```

Special cases:
- Any number to the power of 0 is 1: `x ** 0` is `1`
- Any number to the power of 1 is itself: `x ** 1` is `x`

For the last test, think about what exponent leaves a number
unchanged.
