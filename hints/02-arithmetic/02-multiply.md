# Hint: Multiplication and Division

REXX uses `*` for multiplication and `/` for division:

```rexx
product = 6 * 7       /* product is '42' */
quotient = 10 / 2     /* quotient is '5' */
```

Division returns the exact result:

```rexx
answer = 10 / 4       /* result is '2.5' */
answer = 100 / 4      /* result is '25'  */
```

You can multiply variables just like numbers:

```rexx
width = 12
height = 5
area = width * height   /* area is '60' */
```
