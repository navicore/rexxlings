# Hint: Return Codes — Checking RC

After `ADDRESS SYSTEM` runs a command, `RC` holds the return code.

For a command that succeeds:
```rexx
ADDRESS SYSTEM 'echo test'
/* RC will be 0 */
```

For a command that fails:
```rexx
ADDRESS SYSTEM 'test -f /no/such/file'
/* RC will be non-zero (1) because the file does not exist */
```

Other failing commands you could use:
- `'ls /nonexistent/path'`
- `'false'` (always returns 1)

Replace each `???` with an `ADDRESS SYSTEM` statement.
