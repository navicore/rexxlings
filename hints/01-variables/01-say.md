# Hint: SAY — Your First Output

The `SAY` instruction outputs a value followed by a newline.

To print a literal string, put it in single quotes:

```rexx
SAY 'This is my message'
```

You can also use double quotes:

```rexx
SAY "This is my message"
```

Each `SAY` instruction prints on its own line. You need three
separate `SAY` instructions, one for each line of output.
