# Hint: Variable Assignment

In REXX, assignment uses a single `=` sign:

```rexx
name = 'Alice'
age = 30
```

All values in REXX are strings. Even numbers are stored as strings,
but REXX automatically treats them as numbers when you use arithmetic
operators.

String values should be enclosed in quotes (single or double):

```rexx
city = 'Paris'
city = "Paris"   /* same thing */
```

Numbers do not need quotes, but they are still stored as strings:

```rexx
count = 10
```

Replace each `???` with the value described in the test assertions.
