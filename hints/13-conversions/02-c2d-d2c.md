# Hint: C2D() and D2C() — Character/Decimal Conversion

`C2D(string)` converts a character string to its decimal representation.
For a single character, this gives the ASCII code:

```rexx
SAY C2D('A')   /* prints: 65 */
SAY C2D('z')   /* prints: 122 */
SAY C2D('0')   /* prints: 48 */
```

`D2C(number)` converts a decimal number to the corresponding character:

```rexx
SAY D2C(65)    /* prints: A */
SAY D2C(97)    /* prints: a */
SAY D2C(48)    /* prints: 0 */
```

These are useful for working with ASCII codes. For multi-character strings,
`C2D` treats the bytes as a big-endian number.

Replace each `???` with the correct function call.
