# Hint: REXX Knowledge Quiz

Here are hints for each question:

**Q1:** In REXX, an uninitialized variable returns its own name in
uppercase. So if you never assigned `myvar`, its value is `'MYVAR'`.

**Q2:** REXX has three division-related operators:
- `/` regular division (3 / 2 = 1.5)
- `%` integer division (3 % 2 = 1)
- `//` remainder (3 // 2 = 1)

**Q3:** See Q2 — the remainder (modulo) operator is two forward slashes.

**Q4 & Q5:** The two queue instructions are `PUSH` (top/LIFO) and
`QUEUE` (bottom/FIFO).

**Q6:** `PULL` removes from the queue **and** uppercases the value.
If you push `'hello'`, you pull back `'HELLO'`.

**Q7:** `REVERSE('abc')` returns `'cba'`.

**Q8:** `LEAVE` exits a DO loop early, similar to `break` in other
languages. `ITERATE` skips to the next iteration (like `continue`).

Replace each `???` with the correct string value.
